# Personal Wordlist

*The Aim*
- The aim of the project is to create a tool that allows the user to create a personalised Wordlist for brute force attack attempts
*How does the script work?*
By inputting information that has been acquired by the target, the script will generate a large range of potential password variants.
*Ideas for the future*
For now the idea is to keep this simple and build this as a simple python script however using this in a terminal for one line
code execution seems ideal for this sort of tool.


*What has been done so far..*
I have built out the skeleton for this now and plan on adding more code overtime to iron out this project. So far a simple wordlist can be
created from various input added.

Further plans:
 - Fix bugs in code that can output various numbered passwords.
 - Allow for more variety and fix bug where some input isn't outputted properly (this may do to the rand() module added: **Edit - I have given the wordlist more variety now and fixed input not generating passwords issue.**
 - Build it out so it cater towards one line execution to allow easier one-line code execution.
