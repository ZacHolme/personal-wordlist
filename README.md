# Personal Wordlist

*The Aim*
- The aim of the project is to create a tool that allows the user to create a personalised Wordlist for brute force attack attempts
*How does the script work?*
By inputting information that has been acquired by the target, the script will generate a large range of potential password variants.
*Ideas for the future*
For now the idea is to keep this simple and build this as a simple python script however using this in a terminal for one line
code execution seems ideal for this sort of tool.
